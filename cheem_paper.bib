Projections can easily display aspects of structure that are only of low dimension, and sections–that is, intersections of subspaces with a high-dimensional object–can easily display structure of only low codimension (and hence often high dimension). However, compositions of sections and projections, here called prosections, can display aspects of structure of any intermediate dimension. These statements are relevant for data analysis: projections of data can be easily generated with x-y scatterplots, three-dimensional (3-D) data rotations, and grand tours; sections can be approximated in existing systems by scatterplot brushing and painting. Thus this article is in part an investigation into the principles underlying these techniques.},

By contrast, we adopt a data mining point of view by proposing criteria that search for interesting subsets of the data, as opposed to modeling all of the data equally well. The new criteria do not split based on a compromise between the left and the right bucket; they eﬀectively pick the more interesting bucket and ignore the other.},

The collision includes an intermediate process H → τ +τ −produced with a branching fraction of 6.4\%. The Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge held in 2014 saw many participants sharing ideas on how to improve selection methods in the ATLAS datasets. Here, we attempt this challenge using Random Forests due to its eﬀectiveness in decision making. Four diﬀerent splitting criteria Gini, Information Gain, One-Sided Extreme and One-Sided Purity were used to model our random forests. Classiﬁcation rate of for the background class was found to be 0.76 ± 0.5, 0.75 ± 0.4, 0.53 ± 0.2, 0.66 ± 0.4 for Gini, Information Gain, One-Sided Extreme and One-Sided Purity respectively. The signal class had a classiﬁcation rate of 0.77 ± 0.3, 0.79 ± 0.4, 0.79 ± 0.4, 0.66 ± 0.4 for Gini, Information Gain, One-Sided Extreme and One-Sided Purity respectively. The variable importance was measured according to the splitting criteria, in which some leading order variables were analysed in a predicted model by producing a histogram of the ’true’ data versus density of the predicted model. The preliminary analysis, although lacking in sample size, provided promising indications that it could be an eﬀective method upon further development.},

Sectioning, or slicing, through high dimensions is less common, but can be useful for visualising data with concavities, or non-linear structure. It is associated with conditional distributions in statistics, and also linked brushing between plots in interactive data visualisation. This short technical note describes a simple approach for slicing in the orthogonal space of projections obtained when running a tour, thus presenting the viewer with an interpolated sequence of sliced projections. The method has been implemented in R as an extension to the tourr package, and can be used to explore for concave and non-linear structures in multivariate distributions.},

	abstract = {Data tours follow an exploratory multi-dimensional data visualization concept that provides animations of projections of the multidimensional data to a 2D visual space. To create an animation, a sequence of key projections is provided and morphings between each pair of consecutive key projections are computed, which then can be stitched together to form the data tour. The morphings should be smooth so that a user can easily follow the transformations, and their computations shall be fast to allow for their integration into an interactive visual exploration process. Moreover, if the key projections are chosen to satisfy additional conditions, it is desirable that these conditions are maintained during morphing. Shape preservation is such a desirable condition, as it avoids shape distortions that may otherwise be caused by a projection. We develop a novel efﬁcient morphing algorithms for computing shape-preserving data tours, i.e., data tours constructed for a sequence of shape-preserving linear projections. We propose a stepping strategy for the morphing to avoid discontinuities in the evolution of the projections, where we represent the linear projections using a star-coordinates system. Our algorithms are less computationally involved, produce smoother morphings, and require less user-deﬁned parameter settings than existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

Several SIMD implementations of the Gram–Schmidt process for vector orthogonalization are built, and their behavior with respect to performance and energy is investigated. Especially, different ways to implement the SIMD programs are proposed and several optimizations have been studied. As hardware platforms, the Intel Core, Xeon and Xeon Phi processors with the AVX versions AVX, AVX2 and AVX512 have been used.},

	abstract = {Multivariate data is often visualized using linear projections, produced by techniques such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and projection pursuit. A problem with projections is that they obscure low and high density regions near the center of the distribution. Sections, or slices, can help to reveal them. This paper develops a section pursuit method, building on the extensive work in projection pursuit, to search for interesting slices of the data. Linear projections are used to define sections of the parameter space, and to calculate interestingness by comparing the distribution of observations, inside and outside a section. By optimizing this index, it is possible to reveal features such as holes (low density) or grains (high density). The optimization is incorporated into a guided tour so that the search for structure can be dynamic. The approach can be useful for problems when data distributions depart from uniform or normal, as in visually exploring nonlinear manifolds, and functions in multivariate space. Two applications of section pursuit are shown: exploring decision boundaries from classification models, and exploring subspaces induced by complex inequality conditions from multiple parameter model. The new methods are available in R, in the tourr package.},

The performance of these indexes is examined with respect to ideal behaviour, using simulated data, and then applied to problems from gravitational wave astronomy.

We find that the main impact of the new results, due to \$R\_K{\textasciicircum}\{[1.1,6]\}\$ from LHCb, is a decrease in \$C\_\{10{\textbackslash}mu\}{\textasciicircum}\{NP\}\$ with a reduced uncertainty.

Our relationships to virtual realities, artificial intelligence, neuro-implants or pervasive, cyberphysical systems generate ontological uncertainties, epistemological diffusion and ethical conundrums that require us to consider evolving the current research paradigm. I look to post-humanism and relational ontologies to sketch what I call Entanglement HCI in response. I review selected theories—Actor-Network Theory, Post-Phenomenology, Object-Oriented Ontology, Agential Realism—and their existing influences on HCI literature. Against this background, I develop Entanglement HCI from the following four perspectives: (a) the performative relationship between humans and technology; (b) the re-framing of knowledge generation processes around phenomena; (c) the tracing of accountabilities, responsibilities and ethical encounters; and (d) the practices of design and mattering that move beyond user-centred design.},

	abstract = {Grand tours are a class of methods for visualizing multivariate data, or any finite set of points in n-space. The idea is to create an animation of data projections by moving a 2-dimensional projection plane through n-space. The path of planes used in the animation is chosen so that it becomes dense, that is, it comes arbitrarily close to any plane. One inspiration for the grand tour was the experience of trying to comprehend an abstract sculpture in a museum. One tends to walk around the sculpture, viewing it from many different angles. A useful class of grand tours is based on the idea of continuously interpolating an infinite sequence of randomly chosen planes. Visiting randomly (more precisely: uniformly) distributed planes guarantees denseness of the interpolating path. In computer implementations, 2-dimensional orthogonal projections are specified by two 1- dimensional projections which map to the horizontal and vertical screen dimensions, respectively. Hence, a grand tour is specified by a path of pairs of orthonormal projection vectors. This paper describes an interpolation scheme for smoothly connecting two pairs of orthonormal vectors, and thus for constructing interpolating grand tours. The scheme is optimal in the sense that connecting paths are geodesics in a natural Riemannian geometry.},

If each observation is represented as a point in multidimensional space, this means finding the structure of a configuration of points in high-dimensional space. To find linear relationships among the variables, linear regression, principal components, and factor analysis are often used. One very simple and important kind of structure is clustering. Whenever the points cluster together, the knowledge of this is almost sure to be useful to the man who is interested in the data. Some structure-seeking methods depend on the distances between the points. For example, many cluster-seeking techniques look for collections of points whose interpoint distances are small in some sense. Similarly, the method of parametric mapping starts by calculating the matrix of interpoint distances of the original configuration and subsequently works only with that.},

	abstract = {Projection pursuit describes a procedure for searching high-dimensional data for “interesting” low-dimensional projections via the optimization of a criterion function called the projection pursuit index. By empirically examining the optimization process for several projection pursuit indexes, we observed differences in the types of structure that maximized each index. We were especially curious about differences between two indexes based on expansions in terms of orthogonal polynomials, the Legendre index, and the Hermite index. Being fast to compute, these indexes are ideally suited for dynamic graphics implementations. Both Legendre and Hermite indexes are weighted L 2 distances between the density of the projected data and a standard normal density. A general form for this type of index is introduced that encompasses both indexes. The form clarifies the effects of the weight function on the index's sensitivity to differences from normality, highlighting some conceptual problems with the Legendre and Hermite indexes. A new index, called the Natural Hermite index, which alleviates some of these problems, is introduced. A polynomial expansion of the data density reduces the form of the index to a sum of squares of the coefficients used in the expansion. This drew our attention to examining these coefficients as indexes in their own right. We found that the first two coefficients, and the lowest-order indexes produced by them, are the most useful ones for practical data exploration because they respond to structure that can be analytically identified, and because they have “long-sighted” vision that enables them to “see” large structure from a distance. Complementing this low-order behavior, the higher-order indexes are “short-sighted.” They are able to see intricate structure, but only when they are close to it. We also show some practical use of projection pursuit using the polynomial indexes, including a discovery of previously unseen structure in a set of telephone usage data, and two cautionary examples which illustrate that structure found is not always meaningful.},

The projected data can be rendered as densities or histograms, scatterplots, anaglyphs, glyphs, scatterplot matrices, parallel coordinate plots, time series or images, and viewed using an R graphics device, passed to GGobi, or saved to disk. A tour path can be stored for visualisation or replay. With this package it is possible to quickly experiment with diﬀerent, and new, approaches to tours of data.

We pull these opposing poles closer with two new techniques for rigorous statistical inference of visual discoveries. The “Rorschach” helps the analyst calibrate their understanding of uncertainty and the “lineup” provides a protocol for assessing the signiﬁcance of visual discoveries, protecting against the discovery of spurious structure.},

	abstract = {Most visualization techniques have traditionally used two-dimensional, instead of three-dimensional representations to visualize multidimensional and multivariate data. In this article, a way to demonstrate the underlying superiority of three-dimensional, with respect to two-dimensional, representation is proposed. Specifically, it is based on the inevitable quality degradation produced when reducing the data dimensionality. The problem is tackled from two different approaches: a visual and an analytical approach. First, a set of statistical tests (point classification, distance perception, and outlier identification) using the two-dimensional and three-dimensional visualization are carried out on a group of 40 users. The results indicate that there is an improvement in the accuracy introduced by the inclusion of a third dimension; however, these results do not allow to obtain definitive conclusions on the superiority of three-dimensional representation. Therefore, in order to draw further conclusions, a deeper study based on an analytical approach is proposed. The aim is to quantify the real loss of quality produced when the data are visualized in two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces, in relation to the original data dimensionality, to analyze the difference between them. To achieve this, a recently proposed methodology is used. The results obtained by the analytical approach reported that the loss of quality reaches significantly high values only when switching from three-dimensional to two-dimensional representation. The considerable quality degradation suffered in the two-dimensional visualization strongly suggests the suitability of the third dimension to visualize data.},

Projection pursuit for classiﬁcation ﬁnds projections that reveal differences between classes. Even though projection pursuit is used to bypass the curse of dimensionality, most indexes will not work well when there are a small number of observations relative to the number of variables, known as a large p (dimension) small n (sample size) problem. This paper discusses the relationship between the sample size and dimensionality on classiﬁcation and proposes a new projection pursuit index that overcomes the problem of small sample size for exploratory classiﬁcation.},

The data views are designed for data that have a multivariate component. The approach to displaying data comes from earlier research on building statistical graphics based on data pipelines, in which different aspects of data processing and graphical rendering are organized conceptually into segments of a pipeline. The software design takes advantage of the object-oriented nature of the Java language to open up the data pipeline, allowing developers to have greater control over their visualization applications. Importantly, new types of data views coded to adhere to a few simple design requirements can easily be integrated with existing pipe sections. This allows access to sophisticated linking and dynamic interaction across all (new and existing) view types. Pipe segments can be accessed from data analysis packages such as Omegahat or R, providing a tight coupling of visual and numerical methods.},

Using a screen input device such as a mouse, the analyst can specify, in a visual way, points or regions on the display and cause aspects of the display to change nearly instantaneously. Brushing is a collection of dynamic methods for viewing multidimensional data. It is very effective when used on a scatterplot matrix, a rectangular array of all pairwise scatterplots of the variables. Four brushing operations—highlight, shadow highlight, delete, and label—are carried out by moving a mouse-controlled rectangle, called the brush, over one of the scatterplots. The effect of an operation appears simultaneously on all scatterplots. Three paint modes—transient, lasting, and undo—and the ability to change the shape of the brush allow the analyst to specify collections of points on which the operations are carried out. Brushing can be used in various ways or on certain types of data; these usages are called brush techniques and include the following: single-point and cluster linking, conditioning on a single variable, conditioning on two variables, subsetting with categorical variables, and stationarity probing of a time series.},

Projection pursuit is a procedure for searching high-dimensional data for interesting low-dimensional projections via the optimization of a criterion function called the projection pursuit index. Very few projection pursuit indices incorporate class or group information in the calculation. Hence, they cannot be adequately applied in supervised classification problems to provide low-dimensional projections revealing class differences in the data.

The system covers the following plots for visualization tools in addition to the classical histograms and boxplots: flipped empirical distribution function (Huh 1995), parallel coordinates, Dendrogram, scatterplot matrix, Grand Touring (Asimov 1985), and Tracking Grand Tour (TGT) (Huh \& Kim 2002). With DAVIS we can dynamically explore the structure of data by mouse brushing a portion of the data on any of the above mentioned visualization tools. We can focus, delete or identify the brushed data points, and dynamically link the result to the other visualization tools. DAVIS also enables us to visually investigate the result of mathematical clustering methods by propagating the result of classification to the visualization tools in real time.},

The experiment design and methodology are presented in detail and results indicate that there may indeed be a difference in human performance when visually assessing distances in the considered coordinate systems.

	abstract = {This paper develops a generalization of the scatterplot matrix based on the recognition that most data sets include both categorical and quantitative information. Traditional grids of scatterplots often obscure important features of the data when one or more variables are categorical but coded as numerical. The generalized pairs plot oﬀers a range of displays of paired combinations of categorical and quantitative variables. A mosaic plot, ﬂuctuation diagram, or facetted bar chart may be used to display two categorical variables. A side-byside boxplot, stripplot, facetted histogram, or density plot helps visualize a categorical and a quantitative variable. A traditional scatterplot is suitable for displaying a pair of numerical variables, but options also support density contours or annotating summary statistics such as the correlation and number of missing values, for example. Two diﬀerent packages provide implementations of the generalized pairs plot, gpairs and GGally. The use of the generalized pairs plot may reveal structure in multivariate data which otherwise might go unnoticed in the process of exploratory data analysis.

	abstract = {SummaryIn this paper, we present some graphical techniques for cluster analysis of high-dimensional data. Parallel coordinate plots and parallel coordinate density plots are graphical techniques which map multivariate data into a two-dimensional display. The method has some elegant duality properties with ordinary Cartesian plots so that higher-dimensional mathematical structures can be analyzed. Our high interaction software allows for rapid editing of data to remove outliers and isolate clusters by brushing. Our brushing techniques allow not only for hue adjustment, but also for saturation adjustment. Saturation adjustment allows for the handling of comparatively massive data sets by using the α-channel of the Silicon Graphics workstation to compensate for heavy overplotting.The grand tour is a generalized rotation of coordinate axes in a high-dimensional space. Coupled with the full-dimensional plots allowed by the parallel coordinate display, these techniques allow the data analyst to explore data which is both high-dimensional and massive in size. In this paper we give a description of both techniques and illustrate their use to do inverse regression and clustering. We have used these techniques to analyze data on the order of 250,000 observations in 8 dimensions. Because the analysis requires the use of color graphics, in the present paper we illustrate the methods with a more modest data set of 3848 observations. Other illustrations are available on our web page.},

Furthermore, cosine similarity between two flow direction maps provides a similarity map to compare two scanpaths. Last, we provide examples of basic patterns, visual search task, and art perception. Used together, these techniques provide valuable insights about scanpath exploration and informative illustrations of the eye movement data.},

	abstract = {Bundling visually aggregates curves to reduce clutter and help ﬁnding important patterns in trail-sets or graph drawings. We propose a new approach to bundling based on functional decomposition of the underling dataset. We recover the functional nature of the curves by representing them as linear combinations of piecewise-polynomial basis functions with associated expansion coefﬁcients. Next, we express all curves in a given cluster in terms of a centroid curve and a complementary term, via a set of so-called principal component functions. Based on the above, we propose a two-fold contribution: First, we use cluster centroids to design a new bundling method for 2D and 3D curve-sets. Secondly, we deform the cluster centroids and generate new curves along them, which enables us to modify the underlying data in a statistically-controlled way via its simpliﬁed (bundled) view. We demonstrate our method by applications on real-world 2D and 3D datasets for graph bundling, trajectory analysis, and vector ﬁeld and tensor ﬁeld visualization.},

	abstract = {FiberClay is an immersive multidimensional visualization system. The user can navigate into trail sets to gain a better understanding of dense and complex datasets. Left, the user activated the union brushing interaction to select trails intersected by the two beams in a recorded aircraft trajectory dataset. Middle, the user investigates DTI fiber tracks connecting the two hemisphere of the brain. Right, the user refine a data selection by visually sculpting the query with the two brush interactions while navigating into the different visual mappings (e.g. presets) of the investigated dataset. Abstract— Visualizing 3D trajectories to extract insights about their similarities and spatial configuration is a critical task in several domains. Air traffic controllers for example deal with large quantities of aircrafts routes to optimize safety in airspace and neuroscientists attempt to understand neuronal pathways in the human brain by visualizing bundles of fibers from DTI images. Extracting insights from masses of 3D trajectories is challenging as the multiple three dimensional lines have complex geometries, may overlap, cross or even merge with each other, making it impossible to follow individual ones in dense areas. As trajectories are inherently spatial and three dimensional, we propose FiberClay: a system to display and interact with 3D trajectories in immersive environments. FiberClay renders a large quantity of trajectories in real time using GP-GPU techniques. FiberClay also introduces a new set of interactive techniques for composing complex queries in 3D space leveraging immersive environment controllers and user position. These techniques enable an analyst to select and compare sets of trajectories with specific geometries and data properties. We conclude by discussing insights found using FiberClay with domain experts in air traffic control and neurology.},

One key challenge that increases the size of the exploration space is the number of views that one can generate from a single dataset, based on the use of multiple parameter values and exploration paths. Often, no such single view contains all needed insights. The question thus arises of how we can efﬁciently combine insights from multiple views of a dataset. We propose a set of techniques that considerably reduce the exploration effort for such situations, based on the explicit depiction of the view space, using a small multiple metaphor. We leverage this view space by offering interactive techniques that enable users to explicitly create, visualize, and follow their exploration path. This way, partial insights obtained from each view can be efﬁciently and effectively combined. We demonstrate our approach by applications using real-world datasets from air trafﬁc control, software maintenance, and machine learning.},

	abstract = {Our society has entered a data-driven era, one in which not only are enormous amounts of data being generated daily but there are also growing expectations placed on the analysis of this data. Some data have become simply too large to be displayed and some have too short a lifespan to be handled properly with classical visualization or analysis methods. In order to address these issues, this book explores the potential solutions where we not only visualize data, but also allow users to be able to interact with it. Therefore, this book will focus on two main topics: large dataset visualization and interaction. Graphic cards and their image processing power can leverage large data visualization but they can also be of great interest to support interaction. Therefore, this book will show how to take advantage of graphic card computation power with techniques called GPGPUs (general-purpose computing on graphics processing units). As specific examples, this book details GPGPU usages to produce fast enough visualization to be interactive with improved brushing techniques, fast animations between different data representations, and view simplifications (i.e. static and dynamic bundling techniques). Since data storage and memory limitation is less and less of an issue, we will also present techniques to reduce computation time by using memory as a new tool to solve computationally challenging problems. We will investigate innovative data processing techniques: while classical algorithms are expressed in data space (e.g. computation on geographic locations), we will express them in graphic space (e.g., raster map like a screen composed of pixels). This consists of two steps: (1) a data representation is built using straightforward visualization techniques; and (2) the resulting image undergoes purely graphical transformations using image processing techniques. This type of technique is called image-based visualization. The goal of this book is to explore new computing techniques using image-based techniques to provide efficient visualizations and user interfaces for the exploration of large datasets. This book concentrates on the areas of information visualization, visual analytics, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction. This book opens up a whole field of study, including the scientific validation of these techniques, their limitations, and their generalizations to different types of datasets.},

This gap leads to a lack of distinction between the ends and means of a task, limiting the potential for rigorous analysis. We contribute a multi-level typology of visualization tasks to address this gap, distinguishing why and how a visualization task is performed, as well as what the task inputs and outputs are. Our typology allows complex tasks to be expressed as sequences of interdependent simpler tasks, resulting in concise and ﬂexible descriptions for tasks of varying complexity and scope. It provides abstract rather than domain-speciﬁc descriptions of tasks, so that useful comparisons can be made between visualization systems targeted at different application domains. This descriptive power supports a level of analysis required for the generation of new designs, by guiding the translation of domain-speciﬁc problems into abstract tasks, and for the qualitative evaluation of visualization usage. We demonstrate the beneﬁts of our approach in a detailed case study, comparing task descriptions from our typology to those derived from related work. We also discuss the similarities and differences between our typology and over two dozen extant classiﬁcation systems and theoretical frameworks from the literatures of visualization, humancomputer interaction, information retrieval, communications, and cartography.},

	abstract = {The ability to synthesize realistic patterns of neural activity is crucial for studying neural information processing. Here we used the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework to simulate the concerted activity of a population of neurons. We adapted the Wasserstein-GAN variant to facilitate the generation of unconstrained neural population activity patterns while still beneﬁting from parameter sharing in the temporal domain. We demonstrate that our proposed GAN, which we termed Spike-GAN, generates spike trains that match accurately the ﬁrst- and second-order statistics of datasets of tens of neurons and also approximates well their higher-order statistics. We applied Spike-GAN to a real dataset recorded from salamander retina and showed that it performs as well as state-ofthe-art approaches based on the maximum entropy and the dichotomized Gaussian frameworks. Importantly, Spike-GAN does not require to specify a priori the statistics to be matched by the model, and so constitutes a more ﬂexible method than these alternative approaches. Finally, we show how to exploit a trained SpikeGAN to construct ’importance maps’ to detect the most relevant statistical structures present in a spike train. Spike-GAN provides a powerful, easy-to-use technique for generating realistic spiking neural activity and for describing the most relevant features of the large-scale neural population recordings studied in modern systems neuroscience.},

Semi-structured interviews were completed with some group participants and clinical staff working in the service. Care records were searched for additional contact following the intervention. Qualitative data from young people, parents and clinicians suggested that MBCT was acceptable and feasible and provided strategies to cope. The parent course was reported to provide personal support to parents and helped them cope with their child’s depression whilst also impacting the family, promoted shared understanding of depression and strategies to combat it and addressed intergenerational aspects of depression. Eighty-four per cent of participants attended at least 6/8 sessions, and 48\% required no further intervention within the following year.

We present a new modeling for this problem, accounting for the two factors whose interplay deter- mine the impact on the overall task performance: the difference in errors introduced by performing dimensionality reduction to 2D or 3D, and the difference in human perception errors under different visualization conditions. This two-step framework offers a simple approach to estimate the benefits of using an immersive 3D setup for a particular dataset. Here, the DR errors for a series of roll call voting datasets when using two or three dimensions are evaluated through an empirical task-based approach. The perception error and overall task performance, on the other hand, are assessed through a comparative user study with 30 participants. Results indicated that perception errors were low and similar in all approaches, resulting in overall performance benefits in both desktop and HMD-based 3D techniques. The immersive condition, however, was found to require less effort to find information and less navigation, besides providing much larger subjective perception of accuracy and engagement.},

This publication is intended to (1) stimulate the application of abstract data visualization in such environments and to (2) introduce novel concepts involving the user as an active part of the interactive exploratory visualization process. To motivate discussion, requirements for the visualization of abstract data are reviewed and then related to the properties of immersive environments in order to show its potential for data visualization. This leads to the introduction of a novel concept for immersive visualization based on the involvement of the viewers into the data display. The usefulness of the concept is shown by two examples demonstrating that immersive environments are far more than tools to create visually appealing data representations.},

Unfortunately, making VR available in professional application scenarios or even using it on a regular basis has proven to be challenging. We argue that everyday usage environments, such as office spaces, have introduced constraints that critically affect the design of interaction concepts since well-established techniques might be difficult to use. In our opinion, it is crucial to understand the impact of usage scenarios on interaction design, to successfully develop VR applications for everyday use. To substantiate our claim, we define three distinct usage scenarios in this work that primarily differ in the amount of mobility they allow for. We outline each scenario's inherent constraints but also point out opportunities that may be used to design novel, well-suited interaction techniques for different everyday usage environments. In addition, we link each scenario to a concrete application example to clarify its relevance and show how it affects interaction design.},

We found that, while 3D rotation leads to slower performance, previous exposure to single-axis rotation removes that difference. This shows that an interactive 3D scatterplot can be an effective visual exploration technique for detecting trivariate patterns in the data, and highlights the role of interface learning in design and assessment of novel interfaces.},

Automatic techniques often fail for large and complex datasets, and connectomics researchers may spend weeks or months manually tracing neurons using 2D image stacks. We present a design study of a new virtual reality (VR) system, developed in collaboration with trained neuroanatomists, to trace neurons in microscope scans of the visual cortex of primates. We hypothesize that using consumer-grade VR technology to interact with neurons directly in 3D will help neuroscientists better resolve complex cases and enable them to trace neurons faster and with less physical and mental strain. We discuss both the design process and technical challenges in developing an interactive system to navigate and manipulate terabyte-sized image volumes in VR. Using a number of different datasets, we demonstrate that, compared to widely used commercial software, consumer-grade VR presents a promising alternative for scientists.},

Previous research has shown the positive impact of immersive visualization on data analytics workﬂows, but in most cases insights were based on large-screen setups. In contrast, less research focuses on a close integration of immersive technology into existing, i.e., desktop-based data analytics workﬂows. This implies speciﬁc requirements regarding the usability of such systems, which include, i.e., the prevention of cybersickness. In this work, we present a prototypical application, which offers a ﬁrst set of tools and addresses major challenges for a fully immersive data analytics setting in which the user is sitting at a desktop.

Our environments differ in how they exploit natural human perception and interaction capabilities. We compare an augmented-reality head-mounted display (Microsoft HoloLens), a handheld tablet, and a desktop setup. The novel head-mounted HoloLens display projects stereoscopic images of virtual content into a user's real world and allows for interaction in-situ at the spatial position of the 3D hologram. The tablet is able to interact with 3D content through touch, spatial positioning, and tangible markers, however, 3D content is still presented on a 2D surface. Our hypothesis is that visualization environments that match human perceptual and interaction capabilities better to the task at hand improve understanding of 3D visualizations. To better understand the space of display and interaction modalities in visualization environments, we first propose a classification based on three dimensions: perception, interaction, and the spatial and cognitive proximity of the two. Each technique in our study is located at a different position along these three dimensions. We asked 15 participants to perform four tasks, each task having different levels of difficulty for both spatial perception and degrees of freedom for interaction. Our results show that each of the tested environments is more effective for certain tasks, but that generally the desktop environment is still fastest and most precise in almost all cases.},

Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

In this paper we propose, analyze and evaluate LION-tSNE (Local Interpolation with Outlier coNtrol) - a novel approach for incorporating new data into tSNE representation. LION-tSNE is based on local interpolation in the vicinity of training data, outlier detection and a special outlier mapping algorithm. We show that LION-tSNE method is robust both to outliers and to new samples from existing clusters. We also discuss multiple possible improvements for special cases.

	abstract = {We calculate Bayes factors to quantify how the feasibility of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM) has changed in the light of a series of observations. This is done in the Bayesian spirit where probability reflects a degree of belief in a proposition and Bayes' theorem tells us how to update it after acquiring new information. Our experimental baseline is the approximate knowledge that was available before LEP, and our comparison model is the Standard Model with a simple dark matter candidate. To quantify the amount by which experiments have altered our relative belief in the CMSSM since the baseline data we compute the Bayes factors that arise from learning in sequence the LEP Higgs constraints, the XENON100 dark matter constraints, the 2011 LHC supersymmetry search results, and the early 2012 LHC Higgs search results. We find that LEP and the LHC strongly shatter our trust in the CMSSM (with \$M\_0\$ and \$M\_\{1/2\}\$ below 2 TeV), reducing its posterior odds by a factor of approximately two orders of magnitude. This reduction is largely due to substantial Occam factors induced by the LEP and LHC Higgs searches.},

I use examples from particle and astrophysics to show how we can use the “grand tour” for such multidimensional visualisations, for example to explore grouping in high dimension and for visual identiﬁcation of multivariate outliers. I then discuss the idea of projection pursuit, i.e. searching the high-dimensional space for “interesting” low dimensional projections, and illustrate how we can detect complex associations between multiple parameters.},

The R package tourr provides functions for several types of tours: grand, guided, little, local and frozen. Each of these can be viewed dynamically, or saved into a data object for animation. This paper describes a new package, spinifex, which provides a manual tour of multivariate data where the projection coefﬁcient of a single variable is controlled. The variable is rotated fully into the projection, or completely out of the projection. The resulting sequence of projections can be displayed as an animation, with functions from either the plotly or gganimate packages. By varying the coefﬁcient of a single variable, it is possible to explore the sensitivity of structure in the projection to that variable. This is particularly useful when used with a projection pursuit guided tour to simplify and understand the solution. The use of the manual tour is applied particle physics data to illustrate the sensitivity of structure in a projection to speciﬁc variable contributions.},

	abstract = {Cross-validation (CV) is a technique used to estimate generalization error for prediction models. For pipeline modeling algorithms (i.e. modeling procedures with multiple steps), it has been recommended the entire sequence of steps be carried out during each replicate of CV to mimic the application of the entire pipeline to an external testing set. While theoretically sound, following this recommendation can lead to high computational costs when a pipeline modeling algorithm includes computationally expensive operations, e.g. imputation of missing values. There is a general belief that unsupervised variable selection (i.e. ignoring the outcome) can be applied before conducting CV without incurring bias, but there is less consensus for unsupervised imputation of missing values. We empirically assessed whether conducting unsupervised imputation prior to CV would result in biased estimates of generalization error or result in poorly selected tuning parameters and thus degrade the external performance of downstream models. Results show that despite optimistic bias, the reduced variance of imputation before CV compared to imputation during each replicate of CV leads to a lower overall root mean squared error for estimation of the true external R-squared and the performance of models tuned using CV with imputation before versus during each replication is minimally different. In conclusion, unsupervised imputation before CV appears valid in certain settings and may be a helpful strategy that enables analysts to use more flexible imputation techniques without incurring high computational costs.},

	title = {The {Space}-{Time} {Cube} {Revisited} from a {Geovisualization} {Perspective}},
	abstract = {At the end of the sixties Hägerstrand introduced a space-time model which included features such as a Space-TimePath, and a Space-Time-Prism. His model is often seen as the start of the time-geography studies. Throughout the years his model has been applied and improved to understand our movements through space. Problems studied can be found in different fields of geography, and range from those on an individual movement to whole theories to optimize transportation. From a visualization perspective the Space-Time-Cube was the most prominent element in Hagerstrand’s approach. In its basic appearance these images consist of a cube with on its base a representation of geography (along the x- and y-axis), while the cube’s height represents time (z-axis). A typical Space-Time-Cube could contain the space time-paths of for instance individuals or bus routes. However, when the concept was introduced the options to create the graphics were limited to manual methods and the user could only experience the single view created by the draftsperson. An alternative view on the cube would mean to go through a laborious drawing exercise. Today’s software has options to automatically create the cube and its contents from a database. Data acquisition of space-time paths for both individuals and groups is also made easier using GPS. Today, the user’s viewing environment is, by default, interactive and allows one to view the cube from any direction. In this paper an extended interactive and dynamic visualization environment is proposed, and demonstrated, in which the user has full flexibility to view, manipulate and query the data in a Space-Time-Cube. Included are options to move slider planes along each of the axes to for instance select, or highlight a period in time or location in space. Examples will be discussed in which the time axis is manipulated by for instance changing world time for event time (time cartograms). Creativity should not stop here since it has been shown that especially an alternative perspective on the data will sparkle the mind with new ideas. The user should be allowed to for instance let the x- and/or y-axis be represented by other variables of the theme studied. Since the cube is seen as an integral part of a geovisualization environment the option to link other views with other graphic representation does exist.},

We focus on the task of detecting spatio-temporal patterns in event occurrences. We demonstrate the insufficiency of the existing techniques and approaches to event exploration and substantiate the need in a new exploratory tool. The technique of space-time cube, which has been earlier proposed for the visualization of movement in geographical space, possesses the required properties. However, it must be implemented so as to allow particular interactive manipulations: changing the viewing perspective, temporal focusing, and dynamic linking with a map display through simultaneous highlighting of corresponding symbols. We describe our implementation of the space-time cube technique and demonstrate by an example how it can be used for detecting spatio-temporal clusters of events.},

Here, pattern is shown by a polyline. Slope of poly-line indicates the difference between data values. Variation in slope creates the different types of pattern. Based on slope, pattern can be classified and this kind of classification helps to explore distinct pattern available in dataset. Ordering of the axis affects pattern available in any dataset. Specific arrangement of axis may provide maximum patterns and another arrangement may provide minimum patterns. Ordering of axis in different order to find maximum or minimum pattern requires exponential time.

	abstract = {With the growing importance of time series clustering research, particularly for similarity searches amongst long time series such as those arising in medicine or finance, it is critical for us to find a way to resolve the outstanding problems that make most clustering methods impractical under certain circumstances. When the time series is very long, some clustering algorithms may fail because the very notation of similarity is dubious in high dimension space; many methods cannot handle missing data when the clustering is based on a distance metric. Global measures describing the time series are obtained by applying statistical operations that best capture the underlying characteristics: trend, seasonality, periodicity, serial correlation, skewness, kurtosis, chaos, nonlinearity, and self-similarity. Since the method clusters using extracted global measures, it reduces the dimensionality of the time series and is much less sensitive to missing or noisy data. We further provide a search mechanism to find the best selection from the feature set that should be used as the clustering inputs. The proposed technique has been tested using benchmark time series datasets previously reported for time series clustering and a set of time series datasets with known characteristics. The empirical results show that our approach is able to yield meaningful clusters. The resulting clusters are similar to those produced by other methods, but with some promising and interesting variations that can be intuitively explained with knowledge of the global characteristics of the time series.},

Despite a considerable body of research in the area of forecasting, the focus has largely been on the financial and economic outcomes of the forecasting process as opposed to societal benefits. Our motivation in this study is to promote the latter, with a view to using the forecasting process to advance social and environmental objectives such as equality, social justice and sustainability. We refer to such forecasting practices as Forecasting for Social Good (FSG) where the benefits to society and the environment take precedence over economic and financial outcomes. We conceptualise FSG and discuss its scope and boundaries in the context of the "Doughnut theory". We present some key attributes that qualify a forecasting process as FSG: it is concerned with a real problem, it is focused on advancing social and environmental goals and prioritises these over conventional measures of economic success, and it has a broad societal impact. We also position FSG in the wider literature on forecasting and social good practices. We propose an FSG maturity framework as the means to engage academics and practitioners with research in this area. Finally, we highlight that FSG: (i) cannot be distilled to a prescriptive set of guidelines, (ii) is scalable, and (iii) has the potential to make significant contributions to advancing social objectives.},

	abstract = {In high-dimensional data analysis the curse of dimensionality reasons that points tend to be far away from the center of the distribution and on the edge of high-dimensional space. Contrary to this, is that projected data tends to clump at the center. This gives a sense that any structure near the center of the projection is obscured, whether this is true or not. A transformation to reverse the curse, is defined in this paper, which uses radial transformations on the projected data. It is integrated seamlessly into the grand tour algorithm, and we have called it a burning sage tour, to indicate that it reverses the curse. The work is implemented into the tourr package in R. Several case studies are included that show how the sage visualizations enhance exploratory clustering and classification problems.},

	abstract = {The P value is a measure of statistical evidence that appears in virtually all medical research papers. Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result, the P value's inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued, a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes' factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.},

Here, we develop attribute signatures-interactively crafted graphics that show the geographic variability of statistics of attributes through which the extent of dependency between the attributes and geography can be visually explored. We compute a number of statistical measures, which can also account for variations in time and scale, and use them as a basis for our visualizations. We then employ different graphical configurations to show and compare both continuous and discrete variation of location and scale. Our methods allow variation in multiple statistical summaries of multiple attributes to be considered concurrently and geographically, as evidenced by examples in which the census geography of London and the wider UK are explored.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In the last decade Open Science principles, such as Open Access, study preregistration, use of preprints, making available data and code, and open peer review, have been successfully advocated for and are being slowly adopted in many different research communities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic many publishers and researchers have sped up their adoption of some of these Open Science practices, sometimes embracing them fully and sometimes partially or in a sub-optimal manner. In this article, we express concerns about the violation of some of the Open Science principles and its potential impact on the quality of research output. We provide evidence of the misuses of these principles at different stages of the scientific process. We call for a wider adoption of Open Science practices in the hope that this work will encourage a broader endorsement of Open Science principles and serve as a reminder that science should always be a rigorous process, reliable and transparent, especially in the context of a pandemic where research findings are being translated into practice even more rapidly.

However, established statistical models such as ETS and ARIMA gain their popularity not only from their high accuracy, but they are also suitable for non-expert users as they are robust, efficient, and automatic. In these areas, RNNs have still a long way to go. We present an extensive empirical study and an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for forecasting, that allow us to develop guidelines and best practices for their use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns, otherwise we recommend a deseasonalization step. Comparisons against ETS and ARIMA demonstrate that the implemented (semi-)automatic RNN models are no silver bullets, but they are competitive alternatives in many situations.},

An illustration of its extensibility is that it can be embedded in R. The result is a full marriage between GGobi's direct manipulation graphical environment and R's familiar extensible environment for statistical data analysis.},

	abstract = {Clustering streaming data has gained importance in recent years due to an expanding opportunity to discover knowledge in widely available data streams. As streams are potentially evolving and unbounded sequence of data objects, clustering algorithms capable of performing fast and incremental processing of data points are necessary. This paper presents a method of clustering high-dimensional data streams using approximate methods called streamingRPHash. streamingRPHash combines random projections with locality-sensitivity hashing to construct a high-performance clustering method. streamingRPHash is amenable to distributed processing frameworks such as Map-Reduce, and also has the benefits of constrained overall complexity growth. This paper describes streamingRPHash algorithm and its various configurations. The clustering performance of streamingRPHash is compared to several alternatives. Experimental results show that streamingRPHash has comparable clustering accuracy and substantially lower runtime and memory usage.},

This visual metaphor allows creating a more flexible representation of data than a two-dimensional scatterplot. In this work, we present STAD (Simplified Topological Abstraction of Data), a parameter-free dimensionality reduction method that projects high-dimensional data into a graph. STAD generates an abstract representation of high-dimensional data by giving each data point a location in a graph which preserves the approximate distances in the original high-dimensional space. The STAD graph is built upon the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to which new edges are added until the correlation between the distances from the graph and the original dataset is maximized. Additionally, STAD supports the inclusion of additional functions to focus the exploration and allow the analysis of data from new perspectives, emphasizing traits in data which otherwise would remain hidden. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to two real-world datasets: traffic density in Barcelona and temporal measurements of air quality in Castile and León in Spain.},

However, despite the fact that comparative visualization is frequently needed – scientists, engineers, and even humanists must routinely compare such data – visualization users and practitioners suffer from a lack of adequate Spatial 3D comparative visualization tools and guidelines. Here we survey the field and present a taxonomy for classifying existing and new comparison visualization techniques for such data into four fundamental approaches: Juxtaposition, Superimposition, Interchangeable, and Explicit Encoding. The results clarify the key design decisions and tradeoffs that designers must make to create an effective comparative Spatial 3D data visualization and suggest the potential of emerging hybrid approaches, ones creatively combining aspects of the four fundamental approaches.},

Traditionally visualisation has been straightforward, particularly when studying single-structure/single-property relationships. It is not so straightforward when confronted with a materials data set represented by a large number of features, and containing multi-structure/multi-property relationships. Here we use Kohonen networks, or self-organising maps, to aid in the visualise sets of silver and platinum nanoparticles based on structural similarity and overlay functional properties to reveal hidden patterns and structure/property relationships. We compare these maps to a popular alternative dimension reduction method and find them superior for our cases where the structure/property relationships are highly nonlinear, and the data set is imbalanced, as they often are in materials science.},

	abstract = {The use of head-mounted displays (HMD) for virtual reality (VR) application-based purposes including therapy, rehabilitation, and training is increasing. Despite advancements in VR technologies, many users still experience sickness symptoms. VR sickness may be influenced by technological differences within HMDs such as resolution and refresh rate, however, VR content also plays a significant role. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the literature on HMDs that report Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) scores to determine the impact of content. User factors associated with VR sickness were also examined. A systematic search was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Fifty-five articles met inclusion criteria, representing 3,016 participants (mean age range 19.5–80; 41\% female). Findings show gaming content recorded the highest total SSQ mean 34.26 (95\%CI 29.57–38.95). VR sickness profiles were also influenced by visual stimulation, locomotion and exposure times. Older samples (mean age ≥35 years) scored significantly lower total SSQ means than younger samples, however, these findings are based on a small evidence base as a limited number of studies included older users. No sex differences were found. Across all types of content, the pooled total SSQ mean was relatively high 28.00 (95\%CI 24.66–31.35) compared with recommended SSQ cut-off scores. These findings are of relevance for informing future research and the application of VR in different contexts.},

	abstract = {It is very difficult to process and analyze high-dimensional data directly. Therefore, it is necessary to learn a potential subspace of high-dimensional data through excellent dimensionality reduction algorithms to preserve the intrinsic structure of high-dimensional data and abandon the less useful information. Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are two popular dimensionality reduction methods for high-dimensional sensor data preprocessing. LDA contains two basic methods, namely, classic linear discriminant analysis and FS linear discriminant analysis. In this paper, a new method, called similar distribution discriminant analysis (SDDA), is proposed based on the similarity of samples’ distribution. Furthermore, the method of solving the optimal discriminant vector is given. These discriminant vectors are orthogonal and nearly statistically uncorrelated. The disadvantages of PCA and LDA are overcome, and the extracted features are more effective by using SDDA. The recognition performance of SDDA exceeds PCA and LDA largely. Some experiments on the Yale face database, FERET face database, and UCI multiple features dataset demonstrate that the proposed method is effective. The results reveal that SDDA obtains better performance than comparison dimensionality reduction methods.},

In the last decades many LDA-based dimension reduction algorithms have been reported. Among these methods, orthogonal LDA (OLDA) is a famous one and several different implementations of OLDA have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a new and fast implementation of OLDA. Compared with the other OLDA implementations, our proposed implementation of OLDA is the fastest one when the dimensionality d is larger than the sample size n. Then, based on our proposed implementation of OLDA, we present an incremental OLDA algorithm which can accurately update the projection matrix of OLDA when new samples are added into the training set. The effectiveness of our proposed new OLDA algorithm and its incremental version are demonstrated by some real-world data sets.},

	abstract = {Background
Metabolomics is an emerging field that includes ascertaining a metabolic profile from a combination of small molecules, and which has health applications. Metabolomic methods are currently applied to discover diagnostic biomarkers and to identify pathophysiological pathways involved in pathology. However, metabolomic data are complex and are usually analyzed by statistical methods. Although the methods have been widely described, most have not been either standardized or validated. Data analysis is the foundation of a robust methodology, so new mathematical methods need to be developed to assess and complement current methods. We therefore applied, for the first time, the dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA) to metabolomics data; we also assessed the complementarity of this method with standard statistical methods. Some attributes were transformed in a way allowing us to discover global and local monotonic relationships between condition and decision attributes. We used previously published metabolomics data (18 variables) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and non-ALS patients.
Results
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Orthogonal Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) allowed satisfactory discrimination (72.7\%) between ALS and non-ALS patients. Some discriminant metabolites were identified: acetate, acetone, pyruvate and glutamine. The concentrations of acetate and pyruvate were also identified by univariate analysis as significantly different between ALS and non-ALS patients. DRSA correctly classified 68.7\% of the cases and established rules involving some of the metabolites highlighted by OPLS-DA (acetate and acetone). Some rules identified potential biomarkers not revealed by OPLS-DA (beta-hydroxybutyrate). We also found a large number of common discriminating metabolites after Bayesian confirmation measures, particularly acetate, pyruvate, acetone and ascorbate, consistent with the pathophysiological pathways involved in ALS.
Conclusion
DRSA provides a complementary method for improving the predictive performance of the multivariate data analysis usually used in metabolomics. This method could help in the identification of metabolites involved in disease pathogenesis. Interestingly, these different strategies mostly identified the same metabolites as being discriminant. The selection of strong decision rules with high value of Bayesian confirmation provides useful information about relevant condition–decision relationships not otherwise revealed in metabolomics data.},

That is, links may be “wrapped” across the boundary, allowing additional spreading of node positions to reduce visual clutter. Recent work has investigated such pannable wrapped visualisations, finding them not worse than unwrapped drawings for small networks for path-following tasks. However, they did not evaluate larger networks nor did they consider whether torus-based layout might also better display high-level network structure like clusters. We offer two algorithms for improving toroidal layout that is completely autonomous and automatic panning of the viewport to minimiswe wrapping links. The resulting layouts afford fewer crossings, less stress, and greater cluster separation. In a study of 32 participants comparing performance in cluster understanding tasks, we find that toroidal visualisation offers significant benefits over standard unwrapped visualisation in terms of improvement in error by 62.7\% and time by 32.3\%.},

We explore two main design factors for quantitative data visualisation on virtual globes: i) commonly used primitives (2D bar, 3D bar, circle) and ii) the orientation of these primitives (tangential, normal, billboarded). We evaluate five distinctive visualisation idioms in a user study with 50 participants. The results show that aligning primitives tangentially on the globe’s surface decreases the accuracy of area-proportional circle visualisations, while the orientation does not have a significant effect on the accuracy of length-proportional bar visualisations. We also find that tangential primitives induce higher perceived mental load than other orientations. Guided by these results we design a novel globe visualisation idiom, Geoburst, that combines a virtual globe and a radial bar chart. A preliminary evaluation reports potential benefits and drawbacks of the Geoburst visualisation.},

	abstract = {Finding clusters in data, especially high dimensional data, is challenging when the clusters are of widely diﬀering shapes, sizes, and densities, and when the data contains noise and outliers. We present a novel clustering technique that addresses these issues. Our algorithm ﬁrst ﬁnds the nearest neighbors of each data point and then redeﬁnes the similarity between pairs of points in terms of how many nearest neighbors the two points share. Using this deﬁnition of similarity, our algorithm identiﬁes core points and then builds clusters around the core points. The use of a shared nearest neighbor deﬁnition of similarity alleviates problems with varying densities and high dimensionality, while the use of core points handles problems with shape and size. While our algorithm can ﬁnd the “dense” clusters that other clustering algorithms ﬁnd, it also ﬁnds clusters that these approaches overlook, i.e., clusters of low or medium density which represent relatively uniform regions “surrounded” by non-uniform or higher density areas. We experimentally show that our algorithm performs better than traditional methods (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN, CURE) on a variety of data sets: KDD Cup ‘99 network intrusion data, NASA Earth science time series data, and two-dimensional point sets. The run-time complexity of our technique is O(n2) if the similarity matrix has to be constructed. However, we discuss a number of optimizations that allow the algorithm to handle large data sets eﬃciently.},

The lineup protocol enables statistical significance testing of visual findings, bridging the gulf between exploratory and inferential statistics. In this article, inferential methods for statistical graphics are developed further by refining the terminology of visual inference and framing the lineup protocol in a context that allows direct comparison with conventional tests in scenarios when a conventional test exists. This framework is used to compare the performance of the lineup protocol against conventional statistical testing in the scenario of fitting linear models. A human subjects experiment is conducted using simulated data to provide controlled conditions. Results suggest that the lineup protocol performs comparably with the conventional tests, and expectedly outperforms them when data are contaminated, a scenario where assumptions required for performing a conventional test are violated. Surprisingly, visual tests have higher power than the conventional tests when the effect size is large. And, interestingly, there may be some super-visual individuals who yield better performance and power than the conventional test even in the most difficult tasks.

The proposed methodology leverages the advantage of two discriminant analysis methods to calculate the project index used in the construction of PPtree. The first method used Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a classifier in the construction of PPForest to differentiate between churners and non-churners customers. The second method is a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to achieve linear splitting of variables node during oblique PPtree construction to produce individual classifiers that are robust and more diverse than classical Random Forest},

	abstract = {It has been generally assumed that the use of Givens rotations provides significant advantages over the use of Householder transformations for the orthogonal decomposition of sparse matrices. It is also generally acknowledged that the opposite is true for dense matrices. In this paper, a way of applying Householder reflections is described which is competitive with or superior to the use of Givens rotations for sparse orthogonal decomposition. In other words, the advantage of Householder over Givens for dense matrices can carry over to the sparse case, provided that the implementation of the Householder scheme is done in a certain way. The approach relies heavily on the idea of general row merge trees developed by Liu [12]. Results of numerical experiments are provided which demonstrate the advantages of the new scheme. The method also appears to be attractive for use on vector computers.},

	abstract = {A guided tour helps to visualise high-dimensional data by showing low-dimensional projections along a projection pursuit optimisation path. Projection pursuit is a generalisation of principal component analysis, in the sense that different indexes are used to define the interestingness of the projected data. While much work has been done in developing new indexes in the literature, less has been done on understanding the optimisation. Index functions can be noisy, might have multiple local maxima as well as an optimal maximum, and are constrained to generate orthonormal projection frames, which complicates the optimization. In addition, projection pursuit is primarily used for exploratory data analysis, and finding the local maxima is also useful. The guided tour is especially useful for exploration, because it conducts geodesic interpolation connecting steps in the optimisation and shows how the projected data changes as a maxima is approached. This work provides new visual diagnostics for examining a choice of optimisation procedure, based on the provision of a new data object which collects information throughout the optimisation. It has helped to diagnose and fix several problems with projection pursuit guided tour. This work might be useful more broadly for diagnosing optimisers, and comparing their performance. The diagnostics are implemented in the R package, ferrn.},

Projection Pursuit has been an effective method for ﬁnding interesting low-dimensional projections of multidimensional spaces by optimizing a score function called a projection pursuit index. However, the technique is not scalable to high-dimensional spaces. Here, we introduce a novel method for discovering noteworthy views of high-dimensional data spaces by using binning and random projections. We deﬁne score functions, akin to projection pursuit indices, that characterize visual patterns of the low-dimensional projections that constitute feature subspaces. We also describe an analytic, multivariate visualization platform based on this algorithm that is scalable to extremely large problems.},

While having access to a wide variety of algorithms is helpful, in practice, it is quite difficult for data scientists to choose and parameterize algorithms to get the clustering results relevant for their dataset and analytical tasks. To alleviate this problem, we built Clustervision, a visual analytics tool that helps ensure data scientists find the right clustering among the large amount of techniques and parameters available. Our system clusters data using a variety of clustering techniques and parameters and then ranks clustering results utilizing five quality metrics. In addition, users can guide the system to produce more relevant results by providing task-relevant constraints on the data. Our visual user interface allows users to find high quality clustering results, explore the clusters using several coordinated visualization techniques, and select the cluster result that best suits their task. We demonstrate this novel approach using a case study with a team of researchers in the medical domain and showcase that our system empowers users to choose an effective representation of their complex data.},

Local explainer models have recently been introduced to explain the predictions of complex machine learning models at the instance level. In this paper, we propose Local Rule-based Model Interpretability with k-optimal Associations (LoRMIkA), a novel model-agnostic approach that obtains k-optimal association rules from a neighbourhood of the instance to be explained. Compared with other rule-based approaches in the literature, we argue that the most predictive rules are not necessarily the rules that provide the best explanations. Consequently, the LoRMIkA framework provides a flexible way to obtain predictive and interesting rules. It uses an efficient search algorithm guaranteed to find the k-optimal rules with respect to objectives such as confidence, lift, leverage, coverage, and support. It also provides multiple rules which explain the decision and counterfactual rules, which give indications for potential changes to obtain different outputs for given instances. We compare our approach to other state-of-the-art approaches in local model interpretability on three different datasets and achieve competitive results in terms of local accuracy and interpretability.},

	abstract = {Software Quality Assurance (SQA) planning aims to define proactive plans, such as defining maximum file size, to prevent the occurrence of software defects in future releases. To aid this, defect prediction models have been proposed to generate insights as the most important factors that are associated with software quality. Such insights that are derived from traditional defect models are far from actionable-i.e., practitioners still do not know what they should do or avoid to decrease the risk of having defects, and what is the risk threshold for each metric. A lack of actionable guidance and risk threshold can lead to inefficient and ineffective SQA planning processes. In this paper, we investigate the practitioners' perceptions of current SQA planning activities, current challenges of such SQA planning activities, and propose four types of guidance to support SQA planning. We then propose and evaluate our AI-Driven SQAPlanner approach, a novel approach for generating four types of guidance and their associated risk thresholds in the form of rule-based explanations for the predictions of defect prediction models. Finally, we develop and evaluate an information visualization for our SQAPlanner approach. Through the use of qualitative survey and empirical evaluation, our results lead us to conclude that SQAPlanner is needed, effective, stable, and practically applicable. We also find that 80\% of our survey respondents perceived that our visualization is more actionable. Thus, our SQAPlanner paves a way for novel research in actionable software analytics-i.e., generating actionable guidance on what should practitioners do and not do to decrease the risk of having defects to support SQA planning.},

	abstract = {The grand tour, one of the most popular methods for multidimensional data exploration, is based on orthogonally projecting multidimensional data to a sequence of lower dimensional subspaces and then moving continuously from one to another. By running experiments on screen and in the CAVE virtual environment, we were able to use the method for the 3D rendering of very large relational datasets where projections are made onto 3D subspaces. 3D cluster-guided tour is proposed where sequences of projections are determined by centroids of data clusters. It makes inter-clusterdistance-preserving projections in the perspectives that the data clusters are displayed as separate as possible. The exploration of very large datasets is supported by using volume rendering through texture splatting. Volume rendering takes as input only the aggregation or part of data needed for rendering, which can be retrieved eﬃciently by SQL queries in an ad hoc manner while we explore or drill down large datasets. To facilitate interactive picking and brushing, a kd-tree multidimensional indexing mechanism is designed. Access methods for subspace search and range query are proposed to greatly reduce the cost of searching and picking interesting data records. Various add-on features, such as projecting variable axes and cluster similarity graphs, help further the understanding of data.},

Preprint services do not provide the heuristic cues of a journal's reputation, selection, and peer-review processes that, regardless of their flaws, are often used as a guide for deciding what to read. We conducted a survey of 3759 researchers across a wide range of disciplines to determine the importance of different cues for assessing the credibility of individual preprints and preprint services. We found that cues related to information about open science content and independent verification of author claims were rated as highly important for judging preprint credibility, and peer views and author information were rated as less important. As of early 2020, very few preprint services display any of the most important cues. By adding such cues, services may be able to help researchers better assess the credibility of preprints, enabling scholars to more confidently use preprints, thereby accelerating scientific communication and discovery.},

	abstract = {At 11.59pm on March 30 2020, the Australian and Victorian Government enacted Stage 3 movement
and economic restrictions on Victorian residents in response to outbreaks of of the novel cororonavirus
(COVID-19). Whilst many of these restrictions were repealed in May and June, the Victorian Government
re-imposed Stage 3 restrictions on 11.59pm on 1 July 2020. Stricter Stage 4 restrictions were decreed on
the afternoon of 2 August 2020 and enacted immediately. Using aggregated electricity demand data for
Victoria from January 2015 to September 2020, we find that neither the Stage 3 restrictions imposed on
30 March, nor the marginal shift to Stage 4 restrictions on 2 August, caused average half-hourly(DAILY
MEDIAN?) electricity consumption to materially change. However, we find that statistically significant
changes to intraday seasonality took place when movement restrictions were imposed. In particular, we
find that the effect of initially transitioning to Stage 3 restrictions in late March was stronger than the
marginal effect of moving to stricter Stage 4 restrictions in August.},

	abstract = {Background: Academic performance is at the heart of hiring decisions and funding applications. It is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative metrics. One of those is the venue in which scholarly publications are published. Depending on the perceived (qualitative) or measured (quantitative) prestige associated with a venue, a specific publication will have more or less weight. 

Objectives: We want to understand how visualization researchers consider the prestige of a venue when looking for papers that they could use in their own manuscripts, and how they determine the prestige of any given venue.

Method: We ran an online survey open for 10 days that we sent out to visualization researchers.

Results: We gathered 46 responses from a sample of convenience. We found that publication venue plays the biggest part in how visualization researchers assess research articles. Interestingly, rating systems and metrics are least important criteria for researchers when assessing the quality of a venue. 

Conclusion: We highlight the potential risks around focusing on venue when assessing research articles. We further underline the necessity to discuss with the community on strategies to switch the focus to robustness and reliability to foster better practices and less stressful publishing expectations.

This paper ﬁrst reviews some of the existing quality measures that are based on distance ranking and K-ary neighborhoods. Next, the deﬁnition of the coranking matrix provides a tool for comparing the ranks in the initial data set and some low-dimensional embedding. Rank errors and concepts such as neighborhood intrusions and extrusions can then be associated with different blocks of the co-ranking matrix. Several quality criteria can be cast within this unifying framework; they are shown to involve one or several of these characteristic blocks. Following this line, simple criteria are proposed, which quantify two aspects of the embedding quality, namely its overall quality and its tendency to favor intrusions or extrusions. They are applied to several recent dimensionality reduction methods in two experiments, with both artiﬁcial and real data.},
