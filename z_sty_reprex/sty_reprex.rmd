# Section title

Hello world



# Attempts and notes

Primary errors:

- original error: `! LaTeX Error: Missing \begin{document}.`
- alternative error: `! You can't use \spacefactor in vertical mode.`

Attempt notes:

- Trivial sty files work (mystyles.sty)
- Trivial tex file didn't work.
- jmlr2e.sty doesn't work wholesale, hence:
- Changing to *.tex didn't work.
- Trying to pare back and to isolate the issue:
    - adding \makeatletter and \makeatother to change the order of operations handling @ in marco assignment. _partial success!!_
    - uncommenting .sty file, keeping an eye out for @ in macronames.
    - \makeatletter and \makeatother at top and bottom is back to original error... (); try changing back and forth
